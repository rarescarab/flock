## Flock API

The following outlines server-side requests that can be sent to the Flock API.

+ [Users](#users)
+ [Boards](#boards)
+ [Cards](#cards)
+ [Venues](#venues)

<a name="users"></a>
### Users

##### GET
`Endpoint: /api/users`  

`Example: /api/users?username=myusername`

Append a query to the URL path with a username parameter (accessed by `request.param('username')`). The response sends back a JSON object containing the user's ID, name, username, and an array of populated boards.

##### POST
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {
  authId: // Facebook ID
  name: // user name pulled from Facebook
  username: // user's name trimmed for whitespace and set to lowercase
}
```
The client triggers a POST request when users are signing up or signing in. A Facebook ID is sent in the request along with the user's name and username.

If the Facebook ID is not in the database, a new user profile is created and returned in the response. Otherwise, the user is simply retrieved from the database and sent back to the client.

The response sends back a JSON object containing the user's ID, name, username, and an array of populated boards (or empty array if new profile).

##### UPDATE
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {
  id: // User's unique Mongo-DB-generated ID
  [name]: // User's new name
  [username]: // User's new username
}
```

The client triggers an update to change a user's name or username. The two fields are optional and all other fields are not updatable. Existing fields (i.e., _id, authId, boards) are deleted from the request body to prevent accidental updating.

##### DELETE
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {
  id: // User's unique Mongo-DB-generated ID
}
```

A user's database ID can be sent in a DELETE request to remove that user's profile from the database. The response sends back a an object with information about how many documents were deleted from MongoDB.

<a name="boards"></a>
### Boards

##### GET
`Endpoint: /api/users?id=boardname`  

##### POST
Endpoint: `/api/users`
```javascript
request.body = {}
```

##### UPDATE

`Endpoint: /api/users`  

```javascript
request.body = {}
```

##### DELETE
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {
  id: // Board's unique Mongo-DB-generated ID
}
```

<a name="cards"></a>
### Cards

##### GET

`Endpoint: /api/users`  
`Example: /api/users?id=56d2bdcacffdf1b2b861ec5dS`  

##### POST
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {}
```

##### UPDATE
`Endpoint: /api/users`  

##### DELETE
`Endpoint: /api/users`  
```javascript
request.body = {
  id: // Card's unique Mongo-DB-generated ID
}
```

<a name="venues"></a>
### Venues

##### GET

`Endpoint: /api/users`  
`Example: /api/users?venueId=40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3`

A GET request submits a query to the database for any existing venue data. Client must provide Foursquare's unique venueId as query If the data does not exist, an HTTP request is sent to Foursquare and the returned data is parsed to create a new venue entry.

Foursquare sends back an object with a response property. Within response, Flock is interested in persisting the following information to limit the rate of API requests over time:

> **photoSuffix** : A string URL suffix for linking to an image of the venue.
>
> + `response.venue.bestPhoto.suffix`
>
> **rating** : A decimal rating derived from Foursquare's algorithim to determine a location's popularity (based on a ten-point scale).
> + `response.venue..ratng`
>
> **price** : A number ranging from 1 to 4, which corresponds to a price level. For food venues, 1 is < $10, 2 is $10-$20, 3 is $20-$30, and 4 is > $30 an entree.
> + `response.venue.price.tier`
>
> **tier** : String that represents the price level (i.e., "Cheap", "Moderate", "Pricey", etc.).
> + `response.venue.price.message`
>
> **hours** : An array of objects containing the venue's `days` of operation (i.e., "Mon-Fri") and corresponding business hours as a `renderedTime` (i.e., "10:00 AM–11:00 PM"). `Days` is an array to account for businesses that have different hours on different days. `Open` is also an array to account for businesses that operate at different times during the day (i.e., shops that close between lunch and dinner).
> + `response.venue.hours.timeframes`
> + `response.venue.hours.timeframes.days`
> + `response.venue.hours.timeframes.open[0].renderedTime`

Additionally, there are createdAt and updatedAt fields for keeping track of the last data refresh (see [UPDATE](#update-venue))

##### POST

There is no POST request for venues in the API as this task is managed in the GET request.

<a name="update-venue"></a>
##### UPDATE

`Endpoint: /api/users`  

```javascript
request.body = {
  venueId: '40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3'
}
```

A PUT request anticipates a Foursquare `venueId` in the request body. It triggers an HTTP request from the Foursquare API for venue data and updates existing information in the database. In compliance with Foursquare's API retention policy, any cached data must be refreshed every 30 days.

The `updatedAt` field helps keep track of when the information about a venue was last persisted. See Title IV of the [Foursquare API Platform Policy](https://foursquare.com/legal/api/platformpolicy).


##### DELETE

`Endpoint: /api/users`  

```javascript
request.body = {
  venueId: 40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3
}
```

DELETE requests remove persisted venue documents in the database. A venueId is required to identify the document marked for removal.
